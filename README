NAME
    RT-Extension-UsernameFormat-Organization - Adds a username format option
    for "Name [Org, City, Country]"

DESCRIPTION
    Adds "Name [Organization, City, Country]" to the "Username format"
    preference.

    Only non-empty values are shown, so if your users only have an
    organization and city you'd see something like "John Smith [Best
    Practical, Boston]" without any country. The same goes for Organization
    and City.

INSTALLATION
    "perl Makefile.PL"
    "make"
    "make install"
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::UsernameFormat::Organization');

    Restart your webserver
    Navigate to Logged in as... then Settings and select the new Username
    Format
